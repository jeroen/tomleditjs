# toml

> Read, Write, and Modify TOML files in R

Simple toolkit for parsing and generating TOML text. Based on 
[toml_edit](https://docs.rs/toml_edit/latest/toml_edit/) which 
allows for modifying toml while preserving order, comments, and whitespace.
    
We currently use a [WebAssembly build](https://github.com/rainbowatcher/toml-edit-js) 
of toml_edit such that we do not have to deal with Rust code in R and everything
works without compilation on any platform, including WebR. When Rust becomes better
supported on CRAN and WebR, we could consider binding to Rust directly, although 
it does not make too much of a difference.


## Install

Installation requires no compilation:

```
pak::pak("jeroen/toml")
```

## Example

The `edit_toml` function simply takes a TOML string and returns the modified TOML string:

```r
# Read some TOML dadta
toml <- readLines('https://raw.githubusercontent.com/posit-dev/air/refs/heads/main/Cargo.toml')

# Modify some fields
toml <- edit_toml(toml, 'workspace.package.rust-version', '1.84')
toml <- edit_toml(toml, 'workspace.dependencies.bla', list(path = "./yolo", rev = "123"))
print(toml)
```

You can also parse the toml into an R list:

```r
parse_toml(toml)
```
